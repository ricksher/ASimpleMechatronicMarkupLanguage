# ASimpleMechatronicMarkupLanguage
For facilitating ChatGPT-based assisted generative mechatronic design and for facilitating remote collaboration, I cajoled OpenAI's ChatGPT4 into designing a markup language for specifying mechatronic interactions.  

What follows is my cleaned-up version of what I got it to produce over several guiding prompts.

ChatGPT4:
<i>A 
Simple Mechatronic Markup Language</i> - <br>
Here are its key descriptions & code examples:  
``` 
<actuator>
<sensor>
<control>
<power> 
```

<h4>Attributes </h4>
Each of these tags can have attributes to further specify their characteristics. For example:

``` 
<actuator type="servo" location="x-axis" />
<sensor type="infrared" location="y-axis" />
<control type="PID" />
<power type="battery" voltage="5V" /> 
```

<h4>Interactions</h4>
Mechatronic components interact with each other to perform complex tasks. ASMML could have interaction tags to represent these actions:

``` 
<interaction source="sensor1" target="actuator1" action="trigger" /> 
```
<h4>Device </h4>
Finally, a device can be defined as a collection of components and their interactions:

``` 
<device>
    <actuator id="actuator1" type="servo" location="x-axis" />
    <sensor id="sensor1" type="infrared" location="y-axis" />
    <control id="control1" type="PID" />
    <power id="power1" type="battery" voltage="5V" />
    <interaction source="sensor1" target="actuator1" action="trigger" />
</device> 
```

In this setup, the <device> tag encloses the entirety of a device's description. Each component is given an id attribute, which allows for specific interactions to be defined between them. The <interaction> tag uses these id references in its source and target attributes to denote which components are interacting and in what way. For instance, action="trigger" might mean that when the source component (in this case, sensor1) activates, it causes the target component (actuator1) to perform its action.

You might have complex interactions that involve control logic. For that, you could include a <logic> tag that allows for basic IF-THEN type conditions:

``` 
<logic>
    <if condition="sensor1:active">
        <then action="actuator1:trigger" />
    </if>
</logic> 
```

This hypothetical markup system could be further expanded to include other aspects of a mechatronic system, like error handling, device states, safety measures, and so forth. It's a simple representation that can be easily read and modified by both humans and machines, which makes it a useful tool for designing and troubleshooting mechatronic systems.


<h4>
  Deeper dive into Interactions</h4>

Interactions enable the specifying of either sequential (logical) or simultaneous (physical) interactions in the system.

The ` <logic> ` tag would be used to define a logic-driven **action primitive**, using conditions and actions as we discussed earlier:

``` 
<logic id="triggerLogic">
    <if condition="sensor1:active">
        <then action="actuator1:trigger" />
    </if>
</logic>

<interaction source="sensor1" target="actuator1" action="triggerLogic" /> 
```

In this example, the triggerLogic action primitive is defined using the 
` <logic> ` tag, and is then referenced in the ` <interaction> ` tag.

For the constitutive laws that govern simultaneous, bidirectional interactions, the ` <constitutive> ` tag could be introduced. This would include physical properties and the relationship between them. For example, in the case of a compressible beam or spring:

``` 
<constitutive id="springLaw">
    <property name="springConstant" value="k" />
    <property name="displacement" value="x" />
    <relation formula="F=k*x" />
</constitutive>

<interaction source="object1" target="object2" action="springLaw" /> 
```

Here, the springLaw action primitive is defined by the ` <constitutive> ` tag, encapsulating the physical properties of the spring and the relationship between force (F), spring constant (k), and displacement (x). This action primitive is then applied to the ` <interaction> ` tag, which represents the physical interaction between object1 and object2.
    
<h4> ChatGPT's usual disclaimer </h4>
    
In a real-world setting, the actual language would likely be more intricate and capable of representing much more complex systems and interactions.

As the human who helped ChatGPT4 along in this, I couldn't agree more: this is just the skeleton of a framework for a markup language that demonstrates what's possible. I think this spec straw-man could be fleshed out with many others collaborating.  If you'd like to help out with nurturing ChatGPT4 to develop the spec further, here is a link to the prompt thread.

You can either copy relevant prompts & responses to your own chat instance, or if the permissions allow continue this existing one.     

Since LLM's like ChatGPT4 are natively text-based, then if  designers of mechatronic devices want to enlist LLMs' help in trying different design iterations, the devices will have to be describable in text-readable form.  To facilitate collaboration, whether human or AI-based, the markup language should facilitate collaborators' writing their own component design implementations that the top-level device design can incorporate.
